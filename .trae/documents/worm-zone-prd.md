## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite

* **State Management**: Zustand for game state and UI state

* **Internationalization**: react-i18next for multi-language support

* **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io client

* **Mobile Integration**: MOS SDK for mini-program features

* **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io server

### 5.2 Development Flow

#### 5.2.1 Environment Setup

```bash
# Development command (watches both client and server)
npm run dev

# Port management (if needed)
npx kill-port 3000 5000
```

#### 5.2.2 Code Organization Principles

**DRY Implementation:**

* Shared types between client/server in `/shared/types`

* Reusable game logic in `/shared/game-engine`

* Common utilities in `/shared/utils`

* Socket event definitions in `/shared/events`

**File Structure:**

```
/client
  /public
    /locales       # i18n translation files
      /en          # English translations
        common.json
        game.json
      /kh          # Khmer translations
        common.json
        game.json
      /cn          # Chinese translations
        common.json
        game.json
  /src
    /components     # Reusable UI components
      /modals       # Modal components (Settings, GameOver)
      /ui           # Basic UI components
    /game          # Game-specific logic
    /hooks         # Custom React hooks
    /stores        # Zustand stores
    /services      # API and socket services
    /utils         # Client utilities
    /i18n          # Internationalization setup
/server
  /src
    /controllers   # Route handlers
    /services      # Business logic
    /socket        # Socket.io handlers
    /utils         # Server utilities
/shared           # Common code between client/server
  /types          # TypeScript definitions
  /game-engine    # Core game logic
  /events         # Socket event definitions
  /utils          # Shared utilities
```

#### 5.2.3 Development Guidelines

1. **Orientation Enforcement**: Implement CSS and JavaScript locks for landscape mode
2. **Socket Synchronization**: Use Zustand middleware for socket state sync
3. **Game State Management**: Centralized game state with predictable updates
4. **Internationalization**: react-i18next setup with JSON translation files
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for connection issues
6. **Performance**: 60fps gameplay with optimized rendering

#### 5.2.4 Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests**: Game logic, utilities, and pure functions

* **Integration Tests**: Socket communication and state synchronization

* **Mobile Testing**: Landscape orientation and touch controls

* **Multiplayer Testing**: Room management and real-time sync

### 5.3 Internationalization Setup

#### 5.3.1 Language Support

* **Supported Languages**: English (EN), Khmer (KH), Chinese (CN)
* **Default Language**: English (EN)
* **Language Detection**: Browser language detection with fallback to default
* **Persistence**: Selected language stored in localStorage

#### 5.3.2 Translation Structure

**Translation Files Location**: `/client/public/locales/{language}/`

**File Organization**:
```
/locales
  /en
    common.json     # Common UI elements, buttons, labels
    game.json       # Game-specific terms, scores, messages
  /kh
    common.json     # Khmer translations
    game.json       # Khmer game terms
  /cn
    common.json     # Chinese translations
    game.json       # Chinese game terms
```

**Translation Keys Structure**:
```json
// common.json
{
  "settings": {
    "title": "Settings",
    "language": "Language",
    "sound": "Sound",
    "close": "Close"
  },
  "buttons": {
    "play": "Play",
    "restart": "Restart",
    "close": "Close"
  }
}

// game.json
{
  "score": {
    "current": "Score",
    "highest": "Best Score",
    "rank": "Rank"
  },
  "game": {
    "gameOver": "Game Over",
    "countdown": "Get Ready",
    "waiting": "Waiting for players..."
  }
}
```

#### 5.3.3 Implementation Details

**React-i18next Configuration**:
```typescript
// i18n/index.ts
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import Backend from 'i18next-http-backend';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';

i18n
  .use(Backend)
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    supportedLngs: ['en', 'kh', 'cn'],
    defaultNS: 'common',
    ns: ['common', 'game'],
    backend: {
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'
    },
    detection: {
      order: ['localStorage', 'navigator'],
      caches: ['localStorage']
    }
  });
```

**Language Switching Component**:
```typescript
// components/LanguageSelector.tsx
const LanguageSelector = () => {
  const { i18n } = useTranslation();
  
  const languages = [
    { code: 'en', flag: 'üá∫üá∏', name: 'English' },
    { code: 'kh', flag: 'üá∞üá≠', name: '·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö' },
    { code: 'cn', flag: 'üá®üá≥', name: '‰∏≠Êñá' }
  ];
  
  const changeLanguage = (lng: string) => {
    i18n.changeLanguage(lng);
  };
};
```

### 5.4 Deployment

* **Development**: Local development with hot reload and i18n hot reloading

* **Production**: Optimized builds with environment-specific configs and pre-loaded translations

* **Mobile**: MOS SDK integration for mini-program deployment with language detection

## 7. Game Over Modal State Management

### 7.1 Modal Close Functionality

**Requirement**: When user closes the Game Over modal (via close button, ESC key, or clicking outside), the application should perform a complete state reset equivalent to a hard page reload but within the SPA context.

**Implementation Details**:
- Reset all Zustand store state to initial values (except persistent data like highest score)
- Clear all game objects (snakes, food, dead points)
- Disconnect from current multiplayer room
- Reset socket connection state
- Clear any running timers or intervals
- Reset canvas and UI components to initial state
- Return to initial app state (ready to join new room)

**State Reset Scope**:
```typescript
// Complete state reset includes:
- Game state (isPlaying, isGameOver, score, rank)
- Game objects (mySnake, otherSnakes, foods, deadPoints)
- Room state (currentPlayerId, leaderboard, playerCount)
- UI state (controls, countdown, status)
- Socket state (disconnect and prepare for new connection)
// Preserve only:
- Persistent stats (highestScore)
- User preferences and settings
```

### 7.2 Restart Game Functionality

**Requirement**: When user clicks "Restart" or "Play Again" button, start a new game session without page reload while maintaining the current room context if possible.

**Implementation Details**:
- Reset game-specific state (score, rank, game objects)
- Preserve room connection and player context
- Rejoin the same room or find new room if current is full
- Start new game countdown (3-2-1)
- Initialize fresh game objects and canvas
- Maintain socket connection for seamless transition

**State Reset Scope**:
```typescript
// Restart game reset includes:
- Game state (score: 0, rank: 0, isGameOver: false)
- Game objects (reset snakes, foods, dead points)
- Game status (return to countdown/lobby state)
// Preserve:
- Room connection and player ID
- Socket connection
- Leaderboard context
- User session and preferences
- Highest score and statistics
```

### 7.3 User Interface Requirements

**Modal Controls**:
- **Close Button (√ó)**: Triggers complete state reset
- **ESC Key**: Triggers complete state reset
- **Click Outside Modal**: Triggers complete state reset
- **Play Again Button**: Triggers restart game functionality
- **Spacebar**: Triggers restart game functionality (existing)

**Visual Feedback**:
- Loading states during state transitions
- Clear distinction between close and restart actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (optional)

### 7.4 Technical Implementation

**Zustand Store Actions**:
```typescript
// New store actions required:
resetCompleteState: () => void;  // For modal close
restartGame: () => void;          // For play again
cleanupGameSession: () => void;   // Cleanup utilities
```

**Socket Event Handling**:
- Proper cleanup of socket listeners on complete reset
- Graceful room leaving on modal close
- Room rejoin logic for restart functionality

**Component Lifecycle**:
- Proper cleanup of React components and effects
- Canvas context reset and reinitialization
- Timer and interval cleanup

## 8. Settings Modal Functionality

### 8.1 Settings Modal Requirements

**Trigger**: Settings gear icon positioned in the top-right corner of the Landing Home page

**Modal Behavior**:
- Slide-up animation from bottom of screen
- Blur background overlay
- Modal can be closed by:
  - Close button (√ó) in modal header
  - Clicking outside modal area

- üá∞üá≠ Khmer (KH) - ·ûó·û∂·ûü·û∂·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö
- üá®üá≥ Chinese (CN) - ‰∏≠Êñá

**Selection Behavior**:
- Flag icons with country names
- Selected language shows active state
- Instant UI language update
- Persistent storage in localStorage
- Fallback to browser language detection

**UI Updates on Language Change**:
- All text elements update immediately
- Modal remains open to show changes
- Smooth text transition animations
- No page reload required

### 8.3 Settings State Management

**Zustand Store Integration**:
```typescript
interface SettingsStore {
  // Modal state
  isSettingsOpen: boolean;
  openSettings: () => void;
  closeSettings: () => void;
  
  // Language state
  currentLanguage: 'en' | 'kh' | 'cn';
  changeLanguage: (lang: string) => void;
  
  // Audio settings
  masterVolume: number;
  soundEffects: boolean;
  backgroundMusic: boolean;
  hapticFeedback: boolean;
  
  // Game settings
  orientationLock: boolean;
  performanceMode: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
