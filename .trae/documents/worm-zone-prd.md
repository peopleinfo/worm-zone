### 4.3 Responsiveness

**Landscape-Only Design**: The entire application is optimized exclusively for landscape orientation on mobile devices. Orientation lock is enforced at the application level to prevent rotation to portrait mode.

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite

* **State Management**: Zustand for game state and UI state

* **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io client

* **Mobile Integration**: MOS SDK for mini-program features

* **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io server

### 5.2 Development Flow

#### 5.2.1 Environment Setup

```bash
# Development command (watches both client and server)
npm run dev

# Port management (if needed)
npx kill-port 3000 5000
```

#### 5.2.2 Code Organization Principles

**DRY Implementation:**

* Shared types between client/server in `/shared/types`

* Reusable game logic in `/shared/game-engine`

* Common utilities in `/shared/utils`

* Socket event definitions in `/shared/events`

**File Structure:**

```
/client
  /src
    /components     # Reusable UI components
    /game          # Game-specific logic
    /hooks         # Custom React hooks
    /stores        # Zustand stores
    /services      # API and socket services
    /utils         # Client utilities
/server
  /src
    /controllers   # Route handlers
    /services      # Business logic
    /socket        # Socket.io handlers
    /utils         # Server utilities
/shared           # Common code between client/server
  /types          # TypeScript definitions
  /game-engine    # Core game logic
  /events         # Socket event definitions
  /utils          # Shared utilities
```

#### 5.2.3 Development Guidelines

1. **Orientation Enforcement**: Implement CSS and JavaScript locks for landscape mode
2. **Socket Synchronization**: Use Zustand middleware for socket state sync
3. **Game State Management**: Centralized game state with predictable updates
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for connection issues
5. **Performance**: 60fps gameplay with optimized rendering

#### 5.2.4 Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests**: Game logic, utilities, and pure functions

* **Integration Tests**: Socket communication and state synchronization

* **Mobile Testing**: Landscape orientation and touch controls

* **Multiplayer Testing**: Room management and real-time sync

### 5.3 Deployment

* **Development**: Local development with hot reload

* **Production**: Optimized builds with environment-specific configs

* **Mobile**: MOS SDK integration for mini-program deployment

## 6. API Documentation

### 6.1 Socket Events

#### Client to Server Events

### 6.2 Game State Management

#### Game State Structure
```typescript
interface GameState {
  players: Map<string, Player>;
  foods: Food[];
  deadPoints: DeadPoint[];
  maxFoods: number;
  worldWidth: number;
  worldHeight: number;
}

interface Player {
  id: string;
  socketId: string | null;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  points: Point[];
  angle: number;
  radius: number;
  speed: number;
  color: string;
  score: number;
  alive: boolean;
  isBot?: boolean;
}

interface Food {
  id: number;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  radius: number;
  color: string;
}

interface DeadPoint {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  radius: number;
  color: string;
}
```

#### Bot Management
- Maximum 20 bots allowed simultaneously
- Bots spawn automatically when first human player joins
- Bots are removed permanently when they die
- Bot AI includes collision detection, food consumption, and boundary checking

#### Game Mechanics
- World size: 2000x2000 pixels
- Maximum 1000 food items
- Dead points cleanup when exceeding 5000 items
- Human players respawn after 3 seconds, bots are permanently removed
- Score system: 1 point per food, 1 point per dead point consumed

### 6.3 Server Configuration

#### Server Setup
- **Port**: 9000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- **CORS**: Enabled for all origins
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication with automatic reconnection
- **Static Files**: Disabled (client served separately)

#### Update Intervals
- Bot movement updates: 100ms
- Game statistics broadcast: 5000ms
- Leaderboard updates: 1000ms
- Dead points cleanup: 30000ms

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient collision detection using distance calculations
- Batch processing of dead points
- Periodic cleanup of game objects
- Optimized leaderboard generation with sorting and filtering

## 7. Game Over Modal State Management

### 7.1 Modal Close Functionality

**Requirement**: When user closes the Game Over modal (via close button, ESC key, or clicking outside), the application should perform a complete state reset equivalent to a hard page reload but within the SPA context.

**Implementation Details**:
- Reset all Zustand store state to initial values (except persistent data like highest score)
- Clear all game objects (snakes, food, dead points)
- Disconnect from current multiplayer room
- Reset socket connection state
- Clear any running timers or intervals
- Reset canvas and UI components to initial state
- Return to initial app state (ready to join new room)

**State Reset Scope**:
```typescript
// Complete state reset includes:
- Game state (isPlaying, isGameOver, score, rank)
- Game objects (mySnake, otherSnakes, foods, deadPoints)
- Room state (currentPlayerId, leaderboard, playerCount)
- UI state (controls, countdown, status)
- Socket state (disconnect and prepare for new connection)
// Preserve only:
- Persistent stats (highestScore)
- User preferences and settings
```

### 7.2 Restart Game Functionality

**Requirement**: When user clicks "Restart" or "Play Again" button, start a new game session without page reload while maintaining the current room context if possible.

**Implementation Details**:
- Reset game-specific state (score, rank, game objects)
- Preserve room connection and player context
- Rejoin the same room or find new room if current is full
- Start new game countdown (3-2-1)
- Initialize fresh game objects and canvas
- Maintain socket connection for seamless transition

**State Reset Scope**:
```typescript
// Restart game reset includes:
- Game state (score: 0, rank: 0, isGameOver: false)
- Game objects (reset snakes, foods, dead points)
- Game status (return to countdown/lobby state)
// Preserve:
- Room connection and player ID
- Socket connection
- Leaderboard context
- User session and preferences
- Highest score and statistics
```

### 7.3 User Interface Requirements

**Modal Controls**:
- **Close Button (√ó)**: Triggers complete state reset
- **ESC Key**: Triggers complete state reset
- **Click Outside Modal**: Triggers complete state reset
- **Play Again Button**: Triggers restart game functionality
- **Spacebar**: Triggers restart game functionality (existing)

**Visual Feedback**:
- Loading states during state transitions
- Clear distinction between close and restart actions
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (optional)

### 7.4 Technical Implementation

**Zustand Store Actions**:
```typescript
// New store actions required:
resetCompleteState: () => void;  // For modal close
restartGame: () => void;          // For play again
cleanupGameSession: () => void;   // Cleanup utilities
```

**Socket Event Handling**:
- Proper cleanup of socket listeners on complete reset
- Graceful room leaving on modal close
- Room rejoin logic for restart functionality

**Component Lifecycle**:
- Proper cleanup of React components and effects
- Canvas context reset and reinitialization
- Timer and interval cleanup
