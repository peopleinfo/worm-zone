## Features

### Connection Status Management

The game includes a robust connection status system that handles server disconnections gracefully:

- **Connection Status Modal**: Automatically appears when the server disconnects during gameplay
- **Auto-reconnection**: Attempts to reconnect automatically with exponential backoff
- **Manual Reconnection**: Players can manually attempt to reconnect
- **Game Pausing**: The game automatically pauses when disconnected to prevent desync
- **Connection Indicator**: Shows real-time connection status in the top-left corner
- **Return to Menu**: Option to return to the main menu if reconnection fails

#### Connection Status Indicators:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Connected and playing
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Connected but game paused
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Disconnected

The system supports up to 5 automatic reconnection attempts before requiring manual intervention.
